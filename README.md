## Usage

- generate build script:\
  <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html>
  ```fish
  cmake -S . -B build
        [-G 'Ninja Multi-Config']
  ```
- build:
  ```fish
  cmake --build build
        [-v]
        [--config {Debug|Release|RelWithDebInfo}]
        [-t <target-name>]
  ```

## `include` & `add_subdirectory`

The most commonly used rule is "One CMakeLists.txt per target".

CMake will create a new variable scope with each `add_subdirectory()` call.

## CPM

CPM.cmake is a cross-platform CMake script that adds dependency management capabilities to CMake. It's built as a thin wrapper around CMake's FetchContent module.

## Cross-compilation

- [Cross Compiling With CMake](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/book/mastering-cmake/chapter/Cross%20Compiling%20With%20CMake.html)

Example of providing a toolchain file to cmake.
```fish
cmake -S . -B build_mingw -G 'Ninja Multi-Config' -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=~/mingw.cmake
cmake --build build_mingw
```
